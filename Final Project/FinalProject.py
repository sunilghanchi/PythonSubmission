#Question 1
#Hey you are a chemist from India and you work with degree celsius in your day to day life but due to a project your company had collaborated with a MNC company, where the chemists use degree frainite for their purposes, and to maintain collaboration consistent we want to have a easy degree conversion, 
#Please develop a python based degree converter which takes 째C value and give you output of 째F 
#Input -  째C -> 50
#Output - 째F -> 122 

celsius = float(input("Enter temperature in celsius: "))
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5) + 32
print('%0.2f Celsius is: %0.2f Fahrenheit' %(celsius, fahrenheit))
